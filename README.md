## Seedling FiftyOne
An introductory approach to using a FiftyOne dataset interface with seedling images using BioCLIP 2 classification attempts is available in `seedling-fo.py`.

To set up:
- Create and activate an environment.
- Install libraries in `seedling-fo_requirements.txt` with e.g.:
```bash
uv pip install -r seedling-fo_requirements.txt
```

To run:
```bash
python seedling-fo.py <path-to-images-dir>
```

Additional flags exist as well.
